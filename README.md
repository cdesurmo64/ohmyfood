# Welcome to my ohmyfood project

## About the project

This is the 3rd project I made for my [Web Developer program at OpenClassrooms](https://openclassrooms.com/fr/paths/185-developpeur-web). :mortar_board:

The goal was to develop a website that features restaurant menus, in accordance with the graphic models provided. I also had to include CSS animations.


You can see the result directly on my website, [right there](https://c-line.dev/projets/ohmyfood/index.html).


I used : 
* HTML5
* CSS3
* SASS
* Flexbox
* Google Fonts
* A package.json file
